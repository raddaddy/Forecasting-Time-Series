# Forecasting-Time-Series

This is an R Markdown file that automates various operations on time series data to analyze certain characteristics (stationary, normal distribution, white noise, strict white noise, Gaussian white noise, linear dependencies, non-linear dependencies, and required transformations). This code performs the operations serially on several different series of data.
