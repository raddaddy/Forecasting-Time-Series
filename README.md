# Forecasting-Time-Series

## Introduction
This is an R Markdown file that automates various operations on time series data to analyze certain characteristics (stationary, normal distribution, white noise, strict white noise, Gaussian white noise, linear dependencies, non-linear dependencies, and required transformations). This code performs the operations serially on several different series of data.

## Framework
1) Stationary (Augmented Dickey-Fuller test)
2) Normal (Shapiro test)
3) White Noise (Box-Ljung test)
4) Strict White Noise
5) Gaussian White Noise
6) Linear model
7) Non-linear model
8) Transformations
